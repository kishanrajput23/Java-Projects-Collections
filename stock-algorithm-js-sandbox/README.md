# Stock Algorithm JS Sandbox

To host the website, serve the files in the root project directory, like so:
```
# You can pick python, apache, or anything really
python3.7 http.server 8080 # Use python 3.7 as this version fixes the socket issue with chrome
```
If you have any really cool algorithms, I encourage you to open an issue and post it there.

The website's CSS making your eyeballs bleed? Open a pull request and comment how lazy I am on styling the website properly while sharing your awesome CSS!

Have fun!<br>
