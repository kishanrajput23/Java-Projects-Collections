# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Java Projects Collections repository!

## How to Contribute

- **Add new Java projects or code samples**: Place your project in a relevant folder. If it doesn't fit an existing category, use the `JavaCodes` folder.
- **Improve documentation**: Update or add READMEs, comments, or code explanations.
- **Refactor or organize code**: Help categorize, clean up, or modernize existing code.
- **Report issues**: Clearly describe bugs, missing files, or suggestions for improvement.

## General Rules

- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR).
- Search for existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages and pull request titles.
- Add comments to your code where helpful.
- Create pull requests from a feature branch, not from `main`.
- Follow Java coding conventions and keep code clean and readable.

## Folder Structure

- **Single Java files**: Place in the most appropriate folder by topic. If unsure, use `JavaCodes`.
- **Multi-file projects**: Keep in their own folder with a README if possible.
